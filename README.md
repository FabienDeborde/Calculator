# Calculator

(Part of [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) challenges)


A simple calculator app made using Jade(Pug), Sass (with bootstrap 4), and JavaScript (with jQuery). <br><br>
You can chain mathematical operations and it will give you the intermediate result. <br>
Press the **(-)** button to use negative numbers, **AC** to reset and **=** to get the final result. <br>
If you enter a number after clicking **=**, it will *reset* the current result and let you do new operation on this new number. <br>
If you click on an operator after clicking **=**, you can *chain* again new operations on the previous result.


You can check the app working on [GitHub](https://fabiendeborde.github.io/Calculator/) or on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/fabien_d/full/zdEoqJ/)
